## This folder is ustilizing boot straps alert template but creating it more like a react component with ejs tags so that all you have to do is 
## pass in the following data structure:
## const message = {type: 'select variables', msg: 'The message'}
## SELECT VARIABLES :
## primary ( for blue background )
## secondary ( for gray background )
## success ( for green background )
## danger ( for red background )
## warning ( for yellow background )
## info ( for turquoise background )
## light ( for white background )
## dark ( for black background )
##
## select variables and msg is of type string
## use the ejs include tag to import the file into your ejs template
## and it will show up. Use container div around the ejs tag to reposition it.





## Happy Coding
